# LLM Response Deep Diff Demo

A Python project demonstrating the use of the `deepdiff` package to visualize and analyze differences between Large Language Model (LLM) responses.

## Purpose

This project showcases how to:
- Compare LLM responses before and after performance optimizations
- Utilize the `deepdiff` package for detailed difference analysis
- Visualize structural and content changes in LLM outputs

## Features

- Deep comparison of LLM response structures
- Detailed visualization of changes
- Performance impact analysis
- Sample data stored in JSON format

## Technical Stack

- Python
- deepdiff package
- LLM integration (implementation specific)
- JSON data storage

## Usage

Currently uses hardcoded data from JSON files for demonstration purposes.
Documentation and examples coming soon.
