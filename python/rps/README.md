# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a Python project that implements a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

## How to Play

1. **Select a Level**: The game offers three levels of difficulty:
    - **Level 1**: Both the player and the computer make their signs, and the results are final.
    - **Level 2**: If the user wins the first try, the computer gets to change its pick, and a second verdict of results is generated. The winner of this second round is the final winner.
    - **Level 3**: If the user wins the first try, the computer gets to try again two more times. The final winner is determined after these additional rounds.

2. **Make Your Move**: Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

3. **View Results**: The game will display the results based on the rules of the selected level.
