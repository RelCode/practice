# Trivia Game

This is a console-based trivia game created in Python. It uses the content provided in `content.js` where topics, questions, and answers are contained in a JSON format.

## How It Works

1. When the game starts, it loads and reads the JSON file.
2. The available topics are displayed on the screen for the player to choose from.
3. Once a topic has been selected, questions are displayed with possible answers in a multiple-choice format.
4. The player has to enter a number corresponding to the answer they believe is correct.

It's quite a fun little game!
