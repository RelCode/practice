## Introduction
This repository serves as my personal playground for upskilling in different areas of software development. Here, you'll find projects and code snippets related to Node.js, React, C#, and AI-related technologies such as creating a Python backend. 

## Technologies
The main technologies and languages I will be focusing on include:
- **Node.js**: Building server-side applications and APIs.
- **React**: Developing dynamic and responsive front-end applications.
- **C#**: Exploring desktop applications, game development, and more.
- **Python**: Creating backends, working with AI and machine learning libraries.

## Projects
### Node.js
- **Project 1**: TBD.

### React
- **Project 1**: Basic ToDo Application: You know it had to be, with React you either start with a Calculator or a ToDo... Hopefully the second one will be very revolutionary ðŸ˜Š

### C#
- **Project 1**: TBD.

### Python (AI/Backend)
- **Project 1**: TBD.

## Goals
- **Daily Learning**: Commit to learning something new every day.
- **Consistent Contributions**: Push code to this repository as consistently as possible.
- **Diverse Skillset**: Gain proficiency in multiple programming languages and technologies.
- **Project Completion**: Complete various projects to solidify my understanding and skills.
