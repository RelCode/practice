# Personal Upskilling Repo

Welcome to my Personal Upskilling Repository! This is my dedicated space for learning and experimenting with various programming languages and technologies. My goal is to push myself to learn new things every day and consistently contribute code to this repository.

## Introduction
This repository serves as my personal playground for upskilling in different areas of software development. Here, you'll find projects and code snippets related to Node.js, React, C#, and AI-related technologies such as creating a Python backend. 

## Technologies
The main technologies and languages I will be focusing on include:
- **Node.js**: Building server-side applications and APIs.
- **React**: Developing dynamic and responsive front-end applications.
- **React-Native**: Building cool react-native applications
- **C#**: Exploring desktop applications, game development, and more.
- **Python**: Creating backends, working with AI and machine learning libraries.

## Projects
### Node.js
- **Project 1**: Backend_DB: this is a basic node application that has mysql2 integrated into. This project can be used as a node server or the database can be used for data capturing while the rest of the node application is used as an API endpoint.

### React
- **Project 1**: Basic ToDo Application: Start your React journey with a classic! This ToDo app will not only help you manage tasks but also introduce you to the core concepts of React. Let's make task management revolutionary and fun! ðŸ˜Š
- **Project 2**: Book Ratings Viewer: This application uses a .NET Core API to fetch and display books along with their ratings. It's a step up from the first project, providing a more complex interaction between the front-end and back-end.

### React-Native
- **Project 1**: Landmark Viewer: A single-page React Native application that fetches data from a Node.js backend. The app makes an API call to retrieve an array of landmark images encoded in base64, displaying them in a user-friendly interface.

### C#
- **Project 1**: Console Task Manager: A basic console-based application that allows users to select from a menu to enter new tasks, view old ones, or exit the program.
- **Project 2**: Book Ratings API: A .NET Core Web API project for managing books and their ratings.

### Python (AI/Backend)
- **Project 1**: TBA.

## Goals
- **Daily Learning**: Commit to learning something new every day.
- **Consistent Contributions**: Push code to this repository as consistently as possible.
- **Diverse Skillset**: Gain proficiency in multiple programming languages and technologies.
- **Project Completion**: Complete various projects to solidify my understanding and skills.
